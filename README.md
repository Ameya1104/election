# Election Management System
This is an app made for admins to handle election results. Here, the app completely supports **CRUD** functionality. The admin can check the entire voters list.
The admin can also add new voters, wherein the admin has to fill all the necessary details of the voter. The admin also has the ability to edit or delete a voter's detais.

## What's special?
The admin app features active and closed elections. You can view the number of votes and the winner of the same for all closed elections. Since voting is ongoing for active elections, only the candidate list is visible.
